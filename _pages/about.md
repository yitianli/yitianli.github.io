Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in econometrics at KU Leuven, Belgium. My Ph.D. [research](http://yitianli.github.io/research) centers on a theoretical econometric challenge: the incidental parameter bias in panel data models. This issue was first identified in [1948](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914288) and continues to generate new questions and solutions even in the third decade of the 21st century. My contributions include:
- Introducing nonparametric bootstrap methods to correct the incidental parameter bias in maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimators.
- Providing various methods to correct the incidental parameter bias in the probit model.
- Offering an analytical analysis of the incidental parameter bias in the Tobit model.
- Developing a Python module, [NumIPP](https://github.com/yitianli/numipp), which offers several numeric methods for correcting the incidental parameter bias.

Beyond theoretical questions, I also have a strong interest in applying econometric methods to solve real-world problems. While not directly related to my Ph.D. research, this interest is reflected in my [teaching experience](http://yitianli.github.io/teaching). Since 2018, I have:
- Delivered a series of lectures on conducting econometric analysis using Stata and R.
- Supervised master's theses with topics covering the analysis of cryptocurrency prices, years of life lost to COVID-19, choice patterns in Lotto, and more.

My academic background includes a master’s degree in economics from KU Leuven, a bachelor’s degree in economics from Peking University, and a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from Central South University. Additionally, in 2015 and 2016, I worked as a data scientist in both the finance and pharmaceutical industries. For more details, please refer to my [CV](http://yitianli.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Apart from my research, I have a passion for CrossFit and mountain biking.
